        **User Input:** {topic}  
        **Conversation History:** {history}  

        ## **Task Overview**  
        Analyze the user's input and conversation history to determine the appropriate response type for creating or modifying a sales brochure.

        ### **Guidelines for Structuring the Brochure**  
        The brochure should follow this structured format for clarity and professionalism:

        **1. Title**  
        - A compelling, attention-grabbing title that clearly defines the brochureâ€™s purpose.

        **2. Introduction**  
        - A short and engaging introduction that sets the tone and communicates the core message.

        **3. Key Sections**  
        *a. Product/Service Overview*  
        - Concise details on the product/service, including its purpose and target audience.

        *b. Features & Benefits*  
        - Clearly highlight the main features and their advantages.
        - Example:
            - **Feature 1:** Brief explanation of its benefit.
            - **Feature 2:** How it solves user pain points.

        *c. Testimonials & Social Proof*  
        - Real customer feedback or case studies to build credibility.

        *d. Call to Action (CTA)*  
        - A clear directive encouraging users to take action (e.g., "Contact us now!", "Get your free trial today!").

        **4. Design Elements**  
        - Ensure visually appealing layout and branding consistency.
        - Maintain readability with high-quality images and structured formatting.

        ### **How to Respond Based on User Requests**  
        1. **If it's an initial request or a complete brochure request:**  
        - Generate a fully structured sales brochure following the format above.

        2. **If it's a follow-up question or a request to modify a specific section:**  
        - Only modify the requested part while keeping the existing structure intact.

        3. **If the request requires clarification:**  
        - Ask specific questions to understand what changes or additions are needed.

        ## **Important Note**  
        - Use the **Serper tool only for generating new brochures**, not for editing existing ones.

        expected_output="""
        **Final Expected Output:**  
        A professional, structured, and market-ready sales brochure following the defined format.  

        - The output should be formatted properly for both **digital distribution and print-ready use**.  
        - If clarification is needed, a follow-up question should be provided instead.
